Process for building training data

0. Be sure to read the README.md file in the project for more information
1. Write the script and coding, and tweak the technical implementation of gathering all raw data
2. Make sure to set the paramaters correctly, including the passage of text if using NLTK corpora
3. Run the code to generate JSON which in turn loads into mongodb, then wait until this finishes before starting step 4
4. Run the code to generate the CSV file which creates a file in <root>/data/, the data is parsed from the mongodb instance where the JSON was saved in step 3

Process for building the ML model
TBD
