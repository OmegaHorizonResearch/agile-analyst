# New direction: store vocab words in a single dictionary. Keep track of corpora. At the end, when all corpora have been tallied, generate a dictionary where each key is a corpus and each value is a number between 0 and the number of corpora. During scoring, the number value for each word is put into a counter, then converted into a dictionary for final reporting.

        Uses nested dictionaries to keep lookup times to a minimum. Python dictionaries are implemented with hash tables, and their overhead stays relatively low up to hundreds or thousands of members, so we try to keep each dictionary close to this number of members. Future development directions might include self-adjusting or empirically self-determined dictionary sizes and ratios, where the sizes would all be chosen to maximize lookup time while keeping to minimum complexity.

        Inputs:
            --'vocab', DataFrame. 'vocab' is a pandas DataFrame object. Contains a row for each word in the original corpus. First column is the word. Subsequent columns are filled as needed to specify r-emotion corpus and tier each word belongs to.
            --'weights', python dictionary. 'weights' is a dictionary containing scaling coefficients for each tier of each corpus. These coefficients are meant to scale any word found in a tier based on its frequency. Tiers with more words will have smaller coefficients, and tiers with fewer words will have larger coefficients.

        Outputs: None. Stores as an internal object (an attribute on 'self') an ordered dictionary of ordered dictionaries containing our words as keys in the second order dictionaries and the corpora and tiers it's part of as values in the second order dictionaries.
