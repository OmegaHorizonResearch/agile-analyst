        Uses nested dictionaries to keep lookup times to a minimum. Python dictionaries are implemented with hash tables, and their overhead stays relatively low up to hundreds or thousands of members, so we try to keep each dictionary close to this number of members. Future development directions might include self-adjusting or empirically self-determined dictionary sizes and ratios, where the sizes would all be chosen to maximize lookup time while keeping to minimum complexity.

        Outputs: None. Stores as an internal object (an attribute on 'self') an ordered dictionary of ordered dictionaries containing our words as keys in the second order dictionaries and the corpora and tiers it's part of as values in the second order dictionaries.
