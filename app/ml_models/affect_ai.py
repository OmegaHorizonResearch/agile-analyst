If a word has a lower alphabetical value than a key, it must belong to the prior key. Thus, we will need to specify sequences to use as keys based on the size of our total corpus and secondary dictionaries. Additionally, we will need to consider the unique distribution of words and the letters they begin with in our corpus.
